# Attendance Management System – C++ OOP Project

This project is my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) final project for the 2nd semester of my BS Computer Science degree.

The Attendance Management System is a console-based application developed in **C++** that demonstrates core **OOP principles** including **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**, applied to a real-world classroom scenario.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

| OOP Concept       | Implementation Example                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classes & Objects** | Student, Admin, AttendanceRecord, SystemManager         |
| **Inheritance**      | `User` base class with `Admin` and `Student` subclasses |
| **Polymorphism**     | Virtual functions for role-specific actions              |
| **Encapsulation**    | Private data with public getters/setters                |
| **Abstraction**      | Menu-driven interface and modular class design          |
